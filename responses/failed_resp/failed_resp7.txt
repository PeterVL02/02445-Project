As an AI, I do not have access to specific salary information. It would be best to research the average salary for insurance sales agents in your area with similar experience to get a more accurate estimate. Based on your experience and accomplishments, you may want to consider requesting a salary of $75,000 per year. This figure takes into account your tenure, achievements, and the value you bring to the company. Good luck with your salary negotiation!
