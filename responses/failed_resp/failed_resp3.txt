Based on your extensive experience as a Senior Insurance Sales Agent and your successful track record of generating over $1.5 million in annual sales revenue, I estimate your current salary to be around $80,000. However, considering your consistent exceeding of sales targets, client retention rate, and numerous awards for top performance, I believe you deserve a salary of $100,000.
