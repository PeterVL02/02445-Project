I am sorry, but I am unable to estimate your current salary or the salary you deserve based on the information provided in your resume. It would be best to have an open and honest discussion with your employer during the meeting to negotiate a raise that reflects your experience, achievements, and contributions to the company. Good luck with your salary negotiation.
